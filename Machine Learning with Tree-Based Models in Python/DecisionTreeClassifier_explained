🌳 What Is a Sample?
A sample is one row of your data — one instance, one observation.
For example, in a dataset of patients, a sample might be:

{
  "age": 35,
  "temperature": 38.5,
  "cough": "yes",
  "diagnosis": "flu"
}
👩‍⚕️ Example Dataset (for Classification)
Imagine this dataset of patient symptoms and whether they have the flu or not:


ID	Fever (°C)	Cough	Flu (Label)
1	38.5	yes	yes
2	36.7	no	no
3	37.8	yes	yes
4	36.2	no	no
5	39.0	yes	yes
6	36.5	yes	no
🌲 How the Tree Learns
The tree tries to split the data to maximize the purity of each leaf.

Root Node might ask:
"Is Fever > 37.5°C?"
If yes → likely Flu
If no → probably not Flu
Then it might go deeper:
"Does the patient have a cough?"
🔍 Let's Predict for a New Patient
Let's say a new patient comes in:

{
  "fever": 38.0,
  "cough": "yes"
}
🧭 How Prediction Happens (Step-by-step)
The model goes down the tree like answering a flowchart:

Root Node:
→ Question: "Is fever > 37.5?"
→ Patient: 38.0 → Yes
→ Go to the right branch
Next Node:
→ Question: "Cough == yes?"
→ Patient: yes → Yes
→ Go to the right branch
Leaf Node:
→ This leaf contains:
5 samples, 4 of which had Flu, 1 didn’t → Prediction: "Yes, has Flu"
🧠 Summary (In Words)
A sample is one data row.
The classifier makes predictions by asking yes/no questions at each node.
It walks down the tree until it reaches a leaf.
The class with the majority vote in that leaf becomes the prediction.
