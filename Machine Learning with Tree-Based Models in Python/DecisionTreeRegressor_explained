Let's walk through how a Decision Tree Regressor makes a prediction, using simple terms and a step-by-step example.

🌳 What Is a Sample? A sample is one row of your data — one instance, one observation. For example, in a dataset of house prices, a sample might be:

{
  "square_feet": 1500,
  "bedrooms": 3,
  "price": 300000
}
👨‍💼 Example Dataset (for Regression) Imagine this dataset where we want to predict the price of a house based on its size and number of bedrooms:


ID	Square Feet	Bedrooms	Price ($)
1	  1000	        2	      200000
2	  1500	        3	      300000
3	  2000	        4	      400000
4	  1200	        3	      250000
5	  1800	        3	      350000
6	  1100	        2    	  220000
🌲 How the Tree Learns The Decision Tree Regressor splits the data at each node to predict the target variable (price) by trying to minimize the error within each split.

For example, at the root node, the tree might ask: "Is the square footage > 1500?"

If yes → go to the right branch. If no → go to the left branch.

Then the tree might further split based on the number of bedrooms or other features.

🔍 Let's Predict for a New House Let’s say we want to predict the price of a new house:

{
  "square_feet": 1400,
  "bedrooms": 3
}
🧭 How Prediction Happens (Step-by-step)

Root Node: → Question: "Is square footage > 1500?" → House: 1400 → No → Go to the left branch (Houses with smaller square footage)
Next Node: → Question: "Is number of bedrooms > 2?" → House: 3 → Yes → Go to the right branch (Houses with more than 2 bedrooms)
Leaf Node: → This leaf contains: 2 samples:
House 1 (1000 sqft, 2 bedrooms, $200,000)
House 4 (1200 sqft, 3 bedrooms, $250,000)
→ The average price in this leaf = (200,000 + 250,000) / 2 = $225,000
🧠 Summary (In Words)

A sample is one data row.
The regressor makes predictions by asking questions (like "Is square footage > 1500?") at each node.
It walks down the tree until it reaches a leaf.
The prediction at the leaf is the average of all the target values in that leaf.
Thus, for the new house, the predicted price would be $225,000 based on the average price in the leaf where similar houses are found.
